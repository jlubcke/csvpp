CSV reformatter to align columns

It scratched my particular itch of a massive amount of test code with snippets
of CSV data that I wanted to re-format in tidy columns (while retaining the
indentation).


Features
--------

* Reads a CSV file as input and outputs a pretty-printed version with all
  columns aligned (and indentation retained)
